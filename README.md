# EECS_510_Final_Project

This project is organized into four main folders:

- **Grammar**  
  Contains a PDF of the production rules, a Python script that demonstrates derivations of strings in the language using those rules, and several sample derivations generated by the script.

- **Machine**  
  Contains an image of the two-tape Turing machine, with visuals created in JFLAP.

- **Project_description**  
  Contains a PDF with the full written description of the project.
  NOTE: Both the grammar and the machine can be found in the project description PDF. Additionally, the description of the data structure is in this document as well.

- **Simulator**  
  Contains the Python code used to simulate the two-tape Turing machine, along with the file-based data structure used by the simulator.
