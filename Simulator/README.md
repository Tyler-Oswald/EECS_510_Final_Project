This project uses two Python files in order to test the correctness of the two-tape Turing machine. sim.py is the entry point to this program while turing.py contains a class that represents the machine. 

To run launch the simulation, run python3 sim.py while in the Simulation directoryof the project to start the program.
  
The file data structure path is hard coded into sim.py. So, it should load that in and prompt you for unary input.
