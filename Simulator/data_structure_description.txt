For this project, the machine is encoded in a file data structure. The file has one line for each different type of data stored. This means that the states, alphabet, tape alphabet, start state, accepting state, and transitions are all stored in the file for a total of 6 lines. Additionally, blanks are represented as 0s in this data structure. This makes representing the tape easier in the simulator. Transitions are stored all on one line with each transition following the format below: \\
(Start state, Read tape 1, Read tape 2, New state, Write state 1, Write state 2, Move head 1, Move head 2)
